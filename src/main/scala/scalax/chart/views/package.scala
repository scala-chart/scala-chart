/** This package contains implicit views / implicit conversions. There are different groups of
  * imports available for specific purposes to avoid ambiguous implicit conversions.
  *
  * == CollectionTo*Views ==
  *
  * These contain views that convert ordinary Scala collections to datasets.

  * }}}
  *
  * == SeriesViews ==
  *
  * [[scalax.chart.views.SeriesViews]] contains views that convert the simpler `*Series` datasets
  * to their `*SeriesCollection` counterparts so they can be used by chart factories:
